			<h3>Development Process</h3>
			<p>The purpose of this site is to create an online presence for the business, Nymeria’s Den. The owners operate a pet boarding facility and recently expanded to include dog daycare services. They seek to increase newsletter subscriptions.</p> 
			<p>To ensure the site is user-friendly, I viewed each page on devices with different size screens. I tested each link, checking that the user will land on the correct page and not receive a 404 error. Additionally, I had peers critique the site during development. That identified potential revisions before launch.</p>

			<h3>Project Defense</h3>
			<p>The site uses a blue and yellow color scheme. I chose these colors because of the emotions they arouse. Blue evokes a sense of trust, stability, and friendliness. Yellow, on the other hand, is associated with warmth and happiness.</p> 
			<p>The typography is clean and simple, primarily using Open-Sans or a sans-serif font. That is easy to read and gives a modern feel to the site. This theme carries throughout the site. That creates a cohesive feel and ensures the user can find the information they need.</p>
			<p>Navigation links are at the top and bottom of each page, eliminating excessive scrolling.</p>
			<h4>Site Pages</h4> 
			<p class="tab">&#10037;Home – The main page has an image slider to showcase the facility and its amenities. Cards highlight the daycare and boarding services. In addition, they provide a quick link to the relevant pages. Another card details future events. The company aims to increase newsletter subscriptions. Thus, there is a submission form on this page.</p> 
			<p class="tab">&#10037;Daycare and Boarding – These pages contain images and information specific to the service. The daycare page has a pricing table to help the user effortlessly determine the costs.</p>
			<p class="tab">&#10037;Contact – This page features a colorful graphic and mentions nearby destinations. It has a map to help the user locate the business. Additionally, it lists the address and phone number and includes a link to email the company. The map is currently static. However, Nymeria's Den should obtain a Google Maps API so that the map will be interactive.</p>
			<p class="tab">&#10037;Privacy – Currently, this page is still under construction. As such, it will show an animated “Coming Soon” graphic. In the future, the privacy page will contain detailed information about what data the company tracks and how it plans to use the data. In addition, there will be a link to unsubscribe from the newsletter.</p>
			<p class="tab">&#10037;404 – If the server cannot find a page, the site has a custom 404 page. That will keep the user on the site and help them return to the home page. The page is colorful and has a cute image that coordinates with the rest of the site. View the 404 page <a href="404.html">here.</a></p> 
			<p>I made several changes to the design based on feedback from peer critiquing. Initially, the navigation links were a larger font and increased when the user hovered over them. Unfortunately, this led to the rearranging of the page elements. Several pages had sections of bold typeface, and the page was a fixed size. The navigation font is now smaller and changes color when the user hovers. Bold weight is reserved for headlines and emphasis. To create a cleaner look, all of the text is in a sans-serif font. Navigation links are a bolder weight to make them easier to see. In addition, the site is now responsive so that the user does not have to scroll horizontally to see the content.</p> 
			<h3>Opportunities</h3>
			<p>In a future version, I would like to implement a booking system that would allow the user to book a boarding booking. That requires a database with multiple tables and a RESTful API. I will keep working on the site to make it more responsive. For instance, I want to change an image size based on the screen size.</p>
